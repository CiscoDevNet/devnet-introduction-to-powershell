# Step 3: Writing with PowerShell

Writing to the Host (screen/console) or to a file is accomplished with the `Write` and `Out` Cmdlets. Specifically we will look at `Write-Host` and `Out-File`.

`Write-Host` is an interesting Cmdlet since it is one the does not send anything down the pipeline nor can the  `Write-Host` stream be redirected. If you have ever seen a command where there is a right facing angle bracket `>` just in front of what looks like a filename, then you have witnessed redirection.

`Write-Host` output will output to the host and cannot be captured. If you want to send output down the pipeline, use `Write-Output`. For now lets look at `Write-Host`

### Exercise 6

Use `Write-Host` to write output to the screen.

  1. At the prompt type:

    ```PowerShell
    Write-Host Hi My Name is...
    $output_var = "Hi My Name is..."
    Write-Host $output_var
    Write-Host -ForegroundColor Green $output_var
    Write-Host -ForegroundColor Green -BackgroundColor Black $output_var
    Write-Host (2,4,6,8,10,12) -Separator ", -> " -ForegroundColor Blue -BackgroundColor white
    ```

  </br>Write-Host Output:

  ![](/assets/images/image-13.jpg)

  Pretty simple stuff but you can use `Write-Host` to get your point across.

  Be sure to look at the `Get-Help` for all the **Write** Cmdlets. By now you're thinking I could do a `Get-Command -Name Write-* | %{Get-Help -Name $_.Name}` and get all the help at once.

  Let's try that and output it to a file.

### Exercise 7

Write all the `Get-Help` for Write Cmdlets to a file.

  1. At the prompt type:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-Command -Name Write-* | %{Get-Help -Name $_.Name} | Out-File Output-Cmdlet-Help.txt
    ```

  You did it, but it doesn't look like much happened. Let's see what is in the file that you created.

  2. At the prompt type:

    ```PowerShell
    Get-Content Output-Cmdlet-Help.txt | Out-Host -Paging
    ```

  </br>Get-Command with Get-Help, Out-File and Out-Host Output:

  ![](/assets/images/image-14.jpg)

  Hopefully you saw a paged version of the file. It is that simple to write to a file.

  Is that all there is to PowerShell Output? No, there is quite a bit more, but I'll leave that to you to continue your PowerShell journey. Here's a good place to [start](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)
